The best thing about this campsite is you get close to nature. Giraffes, waterbucks, and zebras are frequent visitors to the campsite. Kiboko has lots of hippos too, with most of them staying just a few yards away from the tents. You can hear them throughout the night, and you get a chance to watch them during the day from your private veranda. Boat rides are also available and I recommend you take them.
